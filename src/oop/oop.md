## OOP Principles

1. Data Abstraction:

    This is a principle in object oriented programming that helps in managing the complexity by hiding implementation details behind interfaces thereby seperating specification from implementation.

2. Encapsulation and information hiding:

    Encapsulation is the packing of data and the functions that operate on the data into one entity.
    
    OOP gives the ability to hide details/implementations from the enduser.

3. Inheritance:

    It is a strong advocate for code reuse. 

4. Polymorphism:
    this is the ability of different objects to respond differently to the same message.
